Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of our formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, and always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels. This is the Drunk Elephant difference.

Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

Clinical Results: In an independent consumer testing panel of 45 women ages 25 to 55:

Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of our formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the “Suspicious 6” in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, and always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels. This is the Drunk Elephant difference.

Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.
